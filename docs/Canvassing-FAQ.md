# CANVASSING APP FAQ

Here we answer the most frequently asked questions that we get.

### Why doesn't the app come pre-loaded with data?

There are laws that regulate voter data, and digital content in general, that vary from State to State, even from County to County. Also, keeping accurate and up to date is expensive; prohibitively so on a national scale. As such, Our Voice USA has opted to, for the foreseeable future, not be in the business of providing canvassing data.

More information about where to get voter files and the applicable laws, visit http://voterlist.electproject.org/

We do provide an import tool so you can import your own data that you acquire through your own means. It's currently in development, find the code here: https://github.com/OurVoiceUSA/HelloVoterHQ

### Where can I get data?

Talk to your County or State Clerk/Secretary for information on how to obtain voter data from the Government. Political parties often provide data to their own candidates, and you can sometimes buy data from various for-profit entities.

You can also just start knocking on doors! Not having any data to start with doesn't prevent you from recording data as you go. The app allows you to add pins and edit the address yourself.

### Why do you integrate with Dropbox?

As Our Voice USA is a non-profit, we aren't able to host data for you for three reasons:

1) non-profits and political parties/candidates don't mix well, legally
2) hosting services can get expensive
3) we value your privacy

Dropbox is a cloud-storage solution which meets our criteria for ease of use and availability, friendly Terms of Service, and built-in data sharing functionality. They offer a decent amount of storage on a free account, so you can truly use our canvassing app at no monetary cost.

### Does Our Voice USA see my data?

No. Your data goes directly from your device to your Dropbox account. You have full control over your data and with whom you choose to share it.

### Will you integrate with cloud storage other than Dropbox?

Our Voice USA has a server-side application in development to be used with the app that you can host anywhere.

### How many people can be on a canvassing team?

Our Canvassing App has been tested with small teams of up to 10 members, and the app performs well. It may be difficult to manage larger groups with the current set of functionality. This will be addressed in a future release of the app.
