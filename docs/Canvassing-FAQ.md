# CANVASSING APP FAQ

Here we answer the most frequently asked questions that we get.

### Why doesn't the app come pre-loaded with data?

There are laws that regulate voter data, and digital content in general, that vary from State to State, even from County to County. Also, keeping accurate and up to date is expensive; prohibitively so on a national scale. As such, Our Voice USA has opted to, for the foreseeable future, not be in the business of providing canvassing data.

More information about where to get voter files and the applicable laws, visit http://voterlist.electproject.org/

We do provide an import tool so you can import your own data that you acquire through your own means. It's called HelloVoterHQ, find it inside our GitHub repository here: https://github.com/OurVoiceUSA/HelloVoter

### Where can I get data?

Talk to your County or State Clerk/Secretary for information on how to obtain voter data from the Government. Political parties often provide data to their own candidates, and you can sometimes buy data from various for-profit entities.

You can also just start knocking on doors! Not having any data to start with doesn't prevent you from recording data as you go. The app allows you to add pins and edit the address yourself.

### Does Our Voice USA see my data?

If you create an account through the app, you are using services provided by Our Voice USA, and we have access to your data. Be assured that your privacy is very important to us. Read our [Privacy Policy](Privacy-Policy.md) and [Terms of Service](Terms-of-Service.md) documents for details.

### Can I use cloud storage other than is provided by Our Voice USA?

Yes! Our open source software includes a server-side application that you can host anywhere. If you know someone with technical expertise, they can set it up for you.

### How many people can be on a canvassing team?

There are no restrictions on the number of people who can be on your canvassing team.
