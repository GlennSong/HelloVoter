## Mobile App

The mobile app is currently located in a different repository due to the fact that it has platform native dependencies and currently operates on a different git branching and release strategy. You can find the repository here: https://github.com/OurVoiceUSA/HelloVoter/

Our ultimate goal is to transition the mobile app to use React Native's "Expo" framework, which would allow us to move the code into this repository. If you have expertise in that area, we'd love the help!
